# Super Dev Command Routing Map

> Version: 2.3.0 | Last updated: 2026-03-31

## Routing Principle

There are exactly TWO execution contexts:

1. **Terminal** — The user's shell. Only used for `pip install super-dev`.
2. **Host** — The AI coding host (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, etc.). Everything else.

When the host receives `/super-dev <args>`, it routes based on the first token:

- **Known subcommand** → Execute via Bash tool: `super-dev <full args>`
- **Natural language** → Enter pipeline mode (research-first workflow)
- **No args** → Execute via Bash tool: `super-dev` (check status, continue)

---

## Terminal ONLY

```bash
pip install super-dev           # Install
pip install -U super-dev        # Upgrade
pip install super-dev[dev]      # Install with dev dependencies
```

These are the ONLY commands a user ever runs in a terminal.

---

## Host Commands (via `/super-dev <args>`)

All commands below are entered in the host as `/super-dev <command>`.
The host executes them via Bash tool automatically.
You do NOT need to open a terminal.

## Complete Known Subcommand List

These are the tokens that trigger Bash execution (not pipeline mode):

```
init, bootstrap, setup, install, start, onboard, detect, doctor, migrate, update,
run, status, next, continue, resume, jump, confirm,
review, release, quality, enforce,
spec, task, config, policy, governance, knowledge,
memory, hooks, experts, compact,
analyze, repo-map, impact, regression-guard, dependency-graph,
feature-checklist, product-audit,
create, pipeline, fix, wizard,
generate, design, deploy, preview, expert, metrics,
skill, integrate, clean, completion, feedback,
studio, workflow
```

Anything NOT in this list is treated as natural language and enters pipeline mode.
